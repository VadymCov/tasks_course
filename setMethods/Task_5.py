# ğŸ”¢ Number Memory Tracker ğŸ§ 
# 
# A sequence analyzer needs to check if each number in a stream has appeared before.
# The system keeps track of previously seen numbers and reports duplicates as they occur,
# ignoring leading zeros in number formatting.
#
# Input:
#   A single line of text containing numbers separated by spaces.
#
# Output:
#   For each number, print "YES" (on a separate line) if this number has appeared 
#   earlier in the sequence, or "NO" otherwise.
#
# Note: Leading zeros in numbers should be ignored.
