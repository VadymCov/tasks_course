# üìä Tracking the success of the solution
#
# An online learning platform should track the progress of students in solving programming problems.
# The system counts the number of students who solved the problem correctly and calculates the
# success rate of all attempts, providing motivating feedback.
#
# Input:
# The first line contains an integer n ‚Äî the total number of solution attempts.
# Then n lines represent the students' solutions in the format:
# <nickname>: <check_system_result>
# where <check_system_result> can be "Correct" or "Incorrect".
#
# Output:
# If there are correct solutions:
# "<number_of_correct_students> students solved correctly"
# "Of all regions, <percentage_of_correct>% correct"
# If there are no correct solutions:
# "You can be the first to solve this problem"
#
# Note 1: Mathematical rounding rules apply - round to the nearest whole number.
# Note 2: Student nicknames are guaranteed to be unique.
# Note 3: Nicknames cannot contain a colon (:).
