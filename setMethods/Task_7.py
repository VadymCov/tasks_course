# # ðŸ”¢ **Number of Matches**
# # The program receives two lines of text containing numbers. Write a program that determines 
# # the number of numbers that are present in both the first line and the second line.
# # 
# # **Input Format**
# # The program receives two lines of text containing numbers separated by spaces.
# # 
# # **Output Format** 
# # The program should output the number of numbers contained simultaneously 
# # in both the first line and the second line.

# # ðŸ”¢ **Common Numbers**
# # The program receives two lines of text containing numbers. Write a program that outputs 
# # all numbers in ascending order that are present in both the first line and the second line.
# # 
# # **Input Format**
# # The program receives two lines of text containing integers separated by spaces.
# # 
# # **Output Format** 
# # The program should output on one line, separated by spaces, the numbers that appear 
# # in both lines.

# ðŸ”¢ **Numbers of the First Line**
# The program receives two lines of text containing numbers. Write a program that outputs 
# all numbers in ascending order that are present in the first line but absent in the second.
# 
# **Input Format**
# The program receives two lines of text containing numbers separated by spaces.

# ðŸ”¢ **Common Digits**
# The program receives a natural number n, and then n different natural numbers, 
# each on a separate line. Write a program that outputs all common digits in 
# ascending order among all entered numbers.

# **Input Format**
# The program receives a natural number n (nâ‰¥1), and then n different natural numbers, 
# each on a separate line.

# **Output Format** 
# The program should output the digits according to the task condition. 
# If there are no common digits, then nothing should be output.
