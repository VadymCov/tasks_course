# ðŸ”° The list 'data' contains information about the population of some US states.
# Write a program to sort the 'data' list in descending order based on the last
# character of the state name. Then, print the elements of this list, each on a
# new line, in the format: <state name>: <population>.
# Note 1: The sorting is performed in descending lexicographical order based on
# the last character of the state name. If two states have the same last character,
# their relative order in the initial list should be preserved (stable sort).
# Note 2: Use an anonymous function (lambda) as the sort key.
