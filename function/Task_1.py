# ðŸ’» Sort as you like

# The list athletes contains information about athletes as tuples: (name, age, height, weight).

# Write a program to sort the list of athletes by the specified field:
# 1: by name;
# 2: by age;
# 3: by height;
# 4: by weight.

# Input format
# The program receives a natural number from 1 to 4 â€“ the field number by which to sort the list.

# Output format
# The program should output the list sorted by the specified field according to the examples.

# Note. Solve the task without using a conditional operator.
