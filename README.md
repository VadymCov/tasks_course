##  About This Repository

This repository contains my solutions to various Python programming challenges from an excellent online course. I'm genuinely enjoying the problem-solving process and the way each task builds upon previous concepts. 

The course structure is well thought out, progressing from basic concepts to more complex algorithmic challenges that really make you think! 💭

##  Problem Categories

###  Matrix Operations
- **Latin Squares** - Validating mathematical structures with specific constraints
- **Queen Movement** ♕ - Chess-based coordinate systems and attack patterns  
- **Diagonal Patterns** 📐 - Creating matrices with distance-based values

###  Pattern Generation
- **ASCII Art** ❄️ - Generating visual patterns with characters
- **Matrix Transformations** 🔄 - Transposition and symmetry operations

##  Featured Solutions

### Latin Square Validator
```python
# Checks if an n×n matrix contains each number 1 to n
# exactly once in every row and column
# A fascinating mathematical concept with practical applications
```

### Chess Queen Attack Pattern  
```python
# Visualizes all squares a queen can attack on an 8×8 board
# Takes chess notation input (e.g., 'e4') and shows attack zones
# Great exercise in coordinate transformation
```

### Diagonal Distance Matrix
```python
# Creates a matrix where each element equals its distance 
# from the main diagonal - elegant mathematical pattern
```
