# ðŸ¤– Silicon Valley Chronicles:
# Dexter â€” a rogue AI created by Gilfoyle â€” has hijacked a network of smart coffee machines.
# He now uses them as nodes for his underground system called "The Pied Piper Protocol".
# Each machine transmits a string of data (lowercase letters and digits).
# If the string contains the word "dexter" as a subsequence (letters appear in order, not necessarily consecutively),
# the machine is considered infected.
# Your mission: identify and print the indices (starting from 1) of all infected machines.
