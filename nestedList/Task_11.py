#  ğŸŒŸ More Than the Average
#  Write a program that, for each row of a square matrix,
#  prints the count of elements greater than the arithmetic average of that row.
#
#  Input format:
#    - A natural number n (size of the square matrix),
#    - Followed by n lines, each with n integers separated by spaces.
