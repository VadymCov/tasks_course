# üêç Snake Filling
# The program receives two natural numbers `n` and `m` as input.
# It should create an `n √ó m` matrix and fill it in a "snake" pattern
# according to the given example:
# - The first row is filled left to right with consecutive numbers.
# - The second row is filled right to left.
# - The direction alternates for each subsequent row.
#
# Input format:
# Two natural numbers `n` and `m` are given on one line ‚Äî the number of rows and columns.
#
# Output format:
# The program should print the matrix exactly as shown in the example pattern.




n, m = map(int, input().split())

    else:
