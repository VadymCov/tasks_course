# ðŸ”· Matrix Filling 3
# The program receives a natural number `n` as input.
# It should create an `n Ã— n` matrix and fill it according to the given example:
# place `1`s on both the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right)
# and the secondary diagonal (top-right to bottom-left),
# while filling all other positions with `0`s.
#
# Input format:
# A natural number `n` â€” the number of rows and columns in the matrix.
#
# Output format:
# The program should print the matrix exactly as shown in the example pattern.
