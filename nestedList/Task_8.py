#  ðŸ§© Print Matrix 1
#  The program receives two natural numbers n and m, each on its own line â€” the number of rows and columns.
#  Then n Ã— m words follow (each on a separate line), row by row.
#  
#  Write a program that reads the matrix elements one by one,
#  then prints them in matrix form.
#
#  Input format:
#  Two numbers n and m (matrix dimensions), then n Ã— m words, each on its own line.
