# ðŸ”Ž Maximum in shaded area 2
# A square matrix is â€‹â€‹given:
# 1) The program receives a natural number n as input
# n is the number of rows and columns in the matrix
# 2) then the matrix elements (integers) one by one, separated by spaces.
#
# Task:
# Find and output the maximum value among all elements of the shaded area.
# The shaded area includes both the main and secondary diagonals, as well as the triangular zones adjacent to them.
#
# Input data:
# First row: n (matrix size)
# Next n rows: each contains n integers (matrix contents)
#
# Output data:
# One integer is the maximum element of the shaded area.
