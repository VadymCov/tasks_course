#  ðŸ§® Matrix Trace
#  The trace of a square matrix is the sum of its main diagonal elements.
#  
#  Input:
#    - A natural number n (matrix dimensions â€” number of rows and columns),
#    - Followed by n lines, each containing row elements (integers) separated by spaces.
#  
#  Task:
#    Read the square matrix and print the trace (sum of the diagonal elements).
