#  ðŸ§® Print Matrix 2
#  The program receives two natural numbers, n and m, each on a separate line â€” number of rows and columns.
#  Then n Ã— m words follow (each on a new line), row by row.
#
#  Write a program that reads the matrix elements one by one,
#  prints them in matrix form, then prints an empty line,
#  followed by the same matrix again but transposed
#  (rows become columns).
#
#  Input format:
#  Two numbers n and m (matrix dimensions), followed by n Ã— m words, each on its own line.
