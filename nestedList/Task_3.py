#  ðŸŒŸ Pascalâ€™s Triangle 1
#  Pascal's Triangle is an infinite triangular array of binomial coefficients.
#  At the top and along the sides are ones. Each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it.
#  
#  Given an input number n, write a program that returns the specified row of Pascal's Triangle as a list (row numbering starts at zero).
#  
#  Input format:
#  A natural number n (n â‰¥ 0) is given as input.
#  
#  Output format:
#  The program should output the specified row of Pascal's Triangle as a list.
