# ðŸŽ¯ Secondary Diagonal Matrix
# The program receives a natural number `n` as input.
# It should create an `n Ã— n` matrix and fill it according to the following rules:
# - Numbers on the secondary diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) are `1`.
# - Numbers above this diagonal are `0`.
# - Numbers below this diagonal are `2`.
#
# After filling, the matrix should be printed row by row,
# with elements in each row separated by a single space.
#
# Input format:
# A natural number `n` â€” the number of rows and columns in the matrix.
#
# Output format:
# The program should print the matrix according to the specified rules.
