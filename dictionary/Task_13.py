# ðŸ§¬ **Genetics Minute**
# As known from biology course, DNA and RNA are sequences of nucleotides.
# Four nucleotides in DNA:
# * adenine (A);
# * cytosine (C);
# * guanine (G);
# * thymine (T).
# 
# Four nucleotides in RNA:
# * adenine (A);
# * cytosine (C);
# * guanine (G);
# * uracil (U).
# 
# RNA chain is built based on DNA chain by sequential attachment of complementary nucleotides:
# * G â†’ C;
# * C â†’ G;
# * T â†’ A;
# * A â†’ U.
# 
# Write a program that translates a DNA chain into an RNA chain.
