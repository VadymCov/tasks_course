# ðŸ”„ **Anagrams 1**
# An anagram is a word (phrase) formed by rearranging the letters that make up 
# another word (or phrase). For example, the English words `evil` and `live` 
# are anagrams.
# The program receives two words as input. Write a program that determines 
# whether they are anagrams.

# **Input format** 
# The program receives two words as input, each on a separate line.

# **Output format** 
# The program should output `YES` if the words are anagrams, or `NO` otherwise.
