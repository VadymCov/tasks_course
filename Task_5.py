# Coordinate Quadrants
# Given a set of points on a coordinate plane, count and output the number of points
# located in each of the four coordinate quadrants.
#
# Input format:
# The first line contains the number of points.
# Each of the following lines contains two integers â€” the coordinates of a point
# (first the x-coordinate, then the y-coordinate), separated by a space.
